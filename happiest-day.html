      <h2>Happiest Day Ever</h2>
      <p>
        On 6/1/2025 i asked ghazal to come with me to an arabic lesson and she
        did the best thing ever she asked me to skip the calss and hang out
        together.like she did feel bad abt it lol but she wanted to hang out
        with me.i was kinda delulu and i thought "fuck she wants to go on a date
        wit me she def loves me" but uhhh unfortunatley she didnt love me.she
        was js showin me kindness but obv i craved her love so bad so i told her
        that i love her.AND SHE FUCKIN SAID YES WHICH MADE MY HEART WANT TO JUMP
        FROM ITS PLACE. and ugh everytime i realise this wasnt real i kinda feel
        like my heart shattring. but i cant deny that this was the best day
        ever.we talked allat we did go to furniture store and we ate
        dounut.everything was perfect. excpet the part where i did force her to
        be my gf and the part i decided to love her the way she wanted to. or i
        thought she wanted to.. cuz yk she told me "my ex did that i didnt like
        it" so i decided not to do it which is partly right cuz i thouht this
        gna make her comfortable. but it made me forget how to love properly.I
        did ask her to hold hands cuz i thought this is how relationships work.
        just to realise.I did ruin everything.i am a failure.i dont deserver to
        be a part of the socity. i cant have good friend i cant have a
        girlfriend i cant hold a relationship for more than a month. anyway i
        did left a soon as she did arrive to her science lesson. i did go home
        and as i am entring my room i think: well maybe life isnt that bad.
        maybe she really loves me, maybe i found myself. but i didnt cuz she did
        break up with me. FUCK.
