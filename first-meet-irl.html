      <h2>First Time to Meet IRL</h2>
      <p>
        On 2/1/2025 it was thursday and it was the first time me and Ghazal to
        meet irl.I asked her to go to the Italian lesson with me and she agreed
        which was fuckin great.Am a fuckin loser I never thought I could meet an
        awsome and gorgrous girl like her.She was differnt.and I am not js sayin
        words like she was rly different I felt special around her she made me
        feel like it is worth it to live.This day i gifted her a hair clip which
        was fav colour (blue btw).We had the lesson and left to get her an uber
        and I cant decribe how i rly felt this day it was fuckin awsome and cute
        fr she had an angelic look.The best part is that we did hang out
        together again!! we had the same philosophy lesson again at the same
        night.We did walk together and talked allat and i told her that she
        looks pretty.idk if i was in rush or nah but this day i rly rly wanted
        to tell her how i feel, how i know that this is crazy. am a crazy mf, a
        bad person, poison but wit her i feel like am the happiest person on
        earth and for the first time i feel like i dont need no girl excpet
        her.I got her to ride to her home and started wandring the streets and i
        was tryin to go home asap so i can talk to her again i didnt want to
        stop talking to her for a single second.I think this was the second
        happiest day i ever lived.
