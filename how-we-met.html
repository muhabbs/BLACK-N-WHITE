      <h2>How We Met</h2>
      <p>
        On 27 of dec 2024. I was sitting in my philosophy class and there was
        this boy his name is RAZA (short for abdelrazek) and RAZA did mention
        about a girl with curly hair. this girl's name was ghazal. As for me
        (muhab) i already knew ghazal and kinda stalked her (in a good
        way).Destiny wanted Ghazal to pop on my instgram suggest to follow. So
        on 29/12/2024 i did follow her and she did follow me back on 30/12/2024.
        On 31/12/2024 tuesday 3am i did send her my letterboxd acc as a ice
        breaker(ik it a bad start lol).We talked alot that day and i knew she
        was that one person.The person who is going to fix everything he didnt
        ruin, the person who is going to change me to the better version of
        me.The answer for everything.But less did i know. That its not easy to
        think someone is the answer.People cant be answers, they are just more
        questions.
