      <h2>After the Break Up</h2>
      <p>
        So on 28/1 she asked me to break up. and its all my fault. i was annoyin
        and i tension our realtionship and shit and i feel sorry about this. we
        had an argument this night and ghosted me and went to sleep the next day
        i did text her and said sorry N asked her sm qs. and she did answer with
        "am sorry we rushed we have to break up". i tried to distance myself but
        its hard istg it is. i have never met someone like her. a pure soul and
        she aint blaming me abt being fucked up, she was pretty like she did
        escape the high heavens.A nd she made me feel special. when we broke up
        i tried allat of times to fix it but i should have known that i cant do
        nun its her life i cant force myself on her again.i did try to kill
        myself and my family knew about it they did take me to a therapy. but it
        didnt help at all it made it worse. he made me concentrate on how fucked
        up i am i did write her letters and i never got da balls to send it to
        her. but i know that one day she gna know abt it.and one day i did text
        her she did reply and she told me that she never liked it, and worse
        that she regret it. i thought she felt loved with me i thought she will
        remember me.but i guess i was js 22 days for her. otherwise she was
        everything for me. so before i text her i decided that i want her to be
        proud of me one day.i did workout of my body and i did cure my body and
        i got job and i became some kind of prodactive person. less do i know
        that i am still depressed and i will always be.i will always be a freak
        to everyone i have to place to go no place felt safe after holdin her
        hands.being with her is the safest feeling ever. but i will always not
        fit in this socity.i wish everything get better soon.
